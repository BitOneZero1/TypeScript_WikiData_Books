# TypeScript_WikiData_Books
JavaScript/TypeScript app for NodeJS CLI to import/modify WikiData books and book editions

# License
multi-licensed. MIT, BSD, Public domain. GitHub doesn't let me choose "Public Domain" as a license, so it is set as none. This README message serves as intention. (c) Copyright 2022, Stephen Alfred Gutknecht. Licensed Public Domain, Cosmos wide.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Some code was used early on from publically available sources that were not Public Domain license. It will take some time to replace that code and identify it. The majority of the code is auhtored directly by me (Stephen Alfred Gutknecht) - so this is mostly a housekeeping need..

# Discussion on Reddit and elsewhere

My username on Reddit and WikiData is "BitOneZero" without the final "1" that is here on GitHub. Seems the name was already taken here ;)

# Install using PNPM

You can likely use other Node package installers/managers. I only tested this app with pnpm on Linux operating system.

pnpm install
pnpm run bundlework
./WikiData_Books_cli.cjs --help
